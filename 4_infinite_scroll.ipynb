Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”\n",

      "“The trouble with having an open mind, of course, is that people will insist on coming along and trying to put things in it.”\n",
      "“If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music.”\n",
      "“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”\n",
      "“Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.”\n",
      "“Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.”\n",

      "“Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere.”\n",
      "“I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.”\n",

      "“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”\n",

      "“You can never get a cup of tea large enough or a book long enough to suit me.”\n",
      "“There is no friend as loyal as a book.”\n",
      "“I have heard there are troubles of more than one kind. Some come from ahead and some come from behind. But I've bought a big bat. I'm all ready you see. Now my troubles are going to have troubles with me!”\n",

She's not perfect—you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her, don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not there.”\n",
      "“All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt.”\n",

      "“Try not to become a man of success. Rather become a man of value.”\n",
      "“To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.”\n",
      "“It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.”\n",
      "“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”\n",
      "“Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.”\n",
      "“Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.”\n",

      "“I am free of all prejudice. I hate everyone equally. ”\n",
      "“What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.”\n",
      "“To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.”\n",
      "“Think left and think right and think low and think high. Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!”\n",
